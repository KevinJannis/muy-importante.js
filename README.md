### Why

Ever had those annoying `!important` statements in CSS that you can't properly override?

So have I, more than once to be honest. Well here is a solution to fix this in a clean way. Instead of using `!important`, use `!muyimportante` and all problems are gone! Seems like magic!


### Muy importante?

I like the sound of it, in a Spanish voice that is.
