It is not just important it is muy importante!

### Why

Ever had those annoying `!important` statements in CSS that you can't properly override?

So have I, more than once to be honest. Well here is a solution to fix this in a clean way.

Instead of using `!important`, use `!muyimportante` and all problems are gone! Seems like magic!

Check below for some examples.

### Examples

`index.html` is a simple test case where CSS files are loaded to override the !important selector in the document.

In general you use `!muyimportante` after a css property to make sure that rule is applied on the document.

### !muyimportante?

I like the hang of it, in a Spanish voice that is.

### Note

This does not work with mediaqueries, perhaps it will some day.

Browser support is IE8+ and every modern browser that supports document.querySelectorAll();
